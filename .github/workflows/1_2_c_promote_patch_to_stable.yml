name: Bump versions for extension only (promotes patch branch to stable release)

# This workflow covers both '1_check_for_updates' and '2_bump_versions' workflows, therefore it is another variant of the same, but specifically for extension only, without any Prisma CLI updates that would need to be handled.
# This is used to manually promote the patch branch to stable and release a new stable version.
